<p>The payoff calculator below shows your earnings from the auction as a function of your value for the widget, your bid, and the bid of the other participant. This includes your initial endowment of 400 cents.   Please enter your bid using the pulldown menu below the payoff calculator. Bids must be in 50 cent increments (0, 50, 100, 150 … 450, 500). You will need to confirm your bid.</p>

<p>The auction is won by the person who submits the highest bid. The winning bidder earns the difference between their value for the widget and the losing bid (i.e. the bid submitted by the other person). The losing bidder earns zero. In case of a tie, you will earn the average of what you would get as the winner and as the loser.</p>

<p>If you cannot remember something about the instructions for the auction, click on the red button labeled “Instructions” to open a pop-up window with the instructions.</p>
