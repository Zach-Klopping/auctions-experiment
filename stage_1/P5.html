<p>After you learn your value for the widget, you will submit a bid for the widget. Bids must be in 50 cent increments (0, 50, 100, 150â€¦ 450, 500). The other participant will also submit a bid for the widget.</p>
<p>The auction is won by the person, you or the other participant, who submits the highest bid. The winning bidder earns the difference between their value for the widget and the losing bid (i.e. the bid submitted by the other person). The losing bidder earns zero. In case of a tie, you will earn the average of what you would get as the winner and as the loser.</p>
<p>Your total payout will consist of the $2.50 for your time, your 400 cent initial endowment, and your earnings from the auction.</p>
{% endif %}

{% if not standard_instructions %}
<p>After you learn your type, you will submit a number between 0 and 10. The other participant will also submit a number between 0 and 10. </p>
<p>Your payoffs for the game depend on your type, your number, and the other participant's number. If you submit the highest number, your payoff is the difference between your type and the other participant's number, multiplied by 50 cents. If your number is the lowest number, your payoff is zero. In case of a tie, your payoff is the difference between your type and the other participant's number, multiplied by 25 cents. </p>
<p>Your total payout will consist of the $2.50 for your time, your 400 cent initial endowment, and your earnings from the game.</p>
