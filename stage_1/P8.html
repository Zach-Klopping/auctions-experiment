<p>Before starting the real auction, please answer the following three questions. These questions test your comprehension of the instructions. All bids used in these questions have been drawn randomly. As such, the bids in these questions do not provide any guidance on how you ought to bid in the real auction.</p>
<p>{% if integrated_payoff_matrix %} You should use the payoff table shown below to answer the quiz questions. {% endif %} If you cannot remember something about the instructions for the auction, click on the red button labeled “Instructions” to open a pop-up window with the instructions.</p>
<p>You will have two chances to answer these questions. If you get them all correct on your first try, you will earn a bonus of 50 cents. If you get them all correct only on your second chance, you will get a bonus of 20 cents. You will be able to continue with the experiment if you do not answer all three questions correctly but will not receive any bonus.</p>
