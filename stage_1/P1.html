  <p class="center-text"><b>Principal Investigator: David Cooper</b></p>
  <p>We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from The University of Iowa. The purpose of the study is to study decision-making in strategic situations.</p>
  <p>If you agree to participate, we would like you to interact with other participants in a game. The details will be described in the experimental instructions. It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete the study procedures.</p>
  <p>You will have the opportunity to earn money based on your decisions and the decisions of other study participants. Subjects in similar experiments typically earn $2 - $10. You will be given the complete details of the payment plan before beginning the experiment. Since we are interested in determining how incentives affect behavior, you will forfeit any earnings if you choose to leave the experimental session early or are dismissed for failing attention checks.</p>
  <p>To help protect your confidentiality, we will not associate your name with any of your study data. Payment information will be stored separately from your responses and used solely for the purposes of payment processing. It will not be possible for the researchers on this project or researchers who may analyze the study data to link you to study responses. If we write a report about this study we will do so in such a way that you cannot be identified. It is highly likely that the study will be published in a journal that requires the sharing of data with other researchers. Only de-identified will be shared - it will not be possible for anybody analyzing the shared data to link you with your data. De-identified data will be stored indefinitely.</p>
  <p>Taking part in this research study is completely voluntary. If you decide not to be in this study, or if you stop participating at any time, except for forfeiting your earnings, you wo't be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify. </p>
  <p>If you have questions about the rights of research subjects, please contact the Human Subjects Office, 105 Hardin Library for the Health Sciences, 600 Newton Rd, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA  52242-1098, (319) 335-6564, or e-mail irb@uiowa.edu.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to ask questions. If you have any questions about the research study itself, please contact: <b>David J. Cooper at (319) 467-4466 or david-j-cooper@uiowa.edu</b></p>
  <p>Thank you very much for your consideration of this research study. </p>
