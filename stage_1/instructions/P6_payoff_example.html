<p>Imagine that you draw a value of 300 cents for the widget and the other participant draws a value of 200 cents. Suppose you bid 400 cents for the widget and the other participant bids 100 cents. </p>
<p>Your bid is higher than the bid of the other participant, so you win the widget. The widget is worth 300 cents to you and you pay 100 cents, the other participant's bid. Your earnings from the auction are 200 cents (300 - 100 = 200). Your total earnings for the experiment are the sum of the $6.50 participation fee plus the $2.00 you earned from the auction. Your total earnings are $8.50.</p>
<p>The other participant did not win the widget. Their earnings from the auction are 0 cents. Their total earnings for the experiment are the sum of the $6.50 participation fee plus the $0 they earned from the auction. Their total earnings are $6.50.</p>
<p>The numbers in this example were chosen to illustrate how payoffs are calculated. They are <b><i>not</i></b> intended to guide how you should choose your bid in the auction. </p>
