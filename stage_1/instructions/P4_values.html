    <p>You will be paired with a computerized bidder to compete in the auction.  You will be randomly assigned a value for the widget. All values are denominated in US cents ($.01). Values range between 0 and 500 cents and are in 50 cent increments. Each possible value (0, 50, 100, 150 … 450, 500) is equally likely to be drawn. </p>

{% if auction_instructions %}
    <p>You will be paired with another experimental participant for the auction. You and the other participant will bid to buy the widget. Each of you will be randomly assigned a value for the widget. All values are denominated in US cents ($.01). Values range between 0 and 500 cents and are in 50 cent increments. Each possible value (0, 50, 100, 150 … 450, 500) is equally likely to be drawn. </p>
    <p>You will know your value for the widget but will not know what value for the widget was drawn for the other experimental participant. The values of the widget for you and the other participant are “independent”. This means that the two values are drawn separately, and knowing your value tells you nothing about the value of the widget for the other participant.</p>

{% if game_instructions %}
    <p>You will be paired with another experimental participant to compete in the game. You and the other participant will each be randomly assigned a “type” for the game. Types range between 0 and 10. Each possible type (0, 1, 2, …., 9, 10) is equally likely to be drawn. The draws for you and the other participant are “independent”. This means that the two draws are done separately, and the outcome of your draw tells you nothing about the outcome for the other participant. You will know your type but will not know what type was drawn for the other experimental participant.</p>
