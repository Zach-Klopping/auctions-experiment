<p>After you learn your value for the widget, you will submit a bid for the widget. Bids must be in 50 cent increments (0, 50, 100, 150â€¦ 450, 500). The other participant will also submit a bid for the widget.</p>
<p>The auction is won by the person, you or the other participant, who submits the highest bid. The winning bidder earns the difference between their value for the widget and the losing bid (i.e. the bid submitted by the other person). The losing bidder earns zero. In case of a tie, you will earn the average of what you would get as the winner and as the loser.</p>
<p>Your total payout will consist of the $2.50 for your time, your 400 cent initial endowment, and your earnings from the auction.</p>
